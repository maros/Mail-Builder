NAME
    Mail::Builder - Easily create plaintext/html e-mail messages with
    attachments and inline images

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::Builder;
      
  my $mail = Mail::Builder->new();
      
  $mail->from('mightypirate@meele-island.mq','Guybrush Threepwood');
      $mail->to->add('manuel.calavera@dod.mx','Manuel Calavera');
      $mail->cc->add('glotis@dod.mx');
      $mail->subject('Party at Sam\'s place');
      $mail->htmltext('<h1>Party invitation</h1> ... ');
      $mail->attachment->add('direction_samandmax.pdf');

      # Send it with your favourite module (e.g. Email::Send)
      my $mailer = Email::Send->new({mailer => 'Sendmail'})->send($mail->stringify);
      
  # Or mess with MIME::Entity objects
      my $mime = $mail->build_message;
      $mime-> ....

DESCRIPTION
    This module helps you to build correct e-mails with attachments, inline
    images, multiple recipients, ... without having to worry about the
    underlying MIME stuff and encoding issues. Mail::Builder relies heavily
    on the MIME::Entity module from the MIME::Tools distribution.

    The module will create the correct MIME bodies, headers and containers
    (multipart/mixed, multipart/related, multipart/alternative) depending on
    if you use attachments, HTML text and inline images.

    Furthermore it will encode non-ascii header data and autogenerate
    plaintext messages (if you don't provide it yourself or disable the
    autotext option) from html content.

    Addresses, attachments and inline images are handled as objects by
    helper classes:

    *   Mail::Builder::Address

        Stores an e-mail address and a display name.

    *   Attachments: Mail::Builder::Attachment::File and
        Mail::Builder::Attachment::Data

        This classes manage attachments which can be created either from
        files in the filesystem or from data in memory.

    *   Inline images:Mail::Builder::Image

        The Mail::Builder::Image class manages images that should be
        displayed in the html e-mail body. (<img src="cid:imageid" />)

    *   Mail::Builder::List

        Helper class for handling list of varoius items (recipient lists,
        attachment lists, image lists)

METHODS
  Constructors
   new
    This is a simple constructor. It does not expect any parameters.

  Public methods
   stringify
    Returns the e-mail message as a string. This string can be passed to
    modules like Email::Send.

    This method is just a shortcut to "$mb->build_message->stringify"

   build_message
     my $entity = $mb->build_message();
     
 # Print the entire message:
     $entity->print(\*STDOUT);
     
 # Stringify the entire message:
     print $entity->stringify;

    Returns the e-mail message as a MIME::Entity object. You can mess around
    with the object, change parts, ... as you wish.

    Every time you call build_message the MIME::Entity object will be
    created, which can take some time if you are sending bulk e-mails. In
    order to increase the processing speed Mail::Builder::Attachment and
    Mail::Builder::Image entities will be cached and only rebuilt if
    something has changed.

  Accessors
   from, returnpath, reply, sender
    These accessors set/return the from, sender and reply address as well as
    the returnpath for bounced messages.

     $obj->from(EMAIL[,NAME])
     OR
     $obj->from(Mail::Builder::Address)

    This accessor always returns a Mail::Builder::Address object.

    To change the attribute value you can either supply a
    Mail::Builder::Address object or scalar parameters which will be passed
    to "Mail::Builder::Address->new". (email address, and an optional
    display name)

   charset (DEPRECATED)
   to, cc, bcc
     $obj->to(Mail::Builder::List)
     OR
     $obj->to(Mail::Builder::Address)
     OR
     $obj->to(EMAIL[,NAME])

    This accessor always returns a Mail::Builder::List object containing
    Mail::Builder::Address objects.

    To alter the values you can either

    *   Manipulate the Mail::Builder::List object (add, remove, ...)

    *   Supply a Mail::Builder::Address object. This will reset the current
        list and add the object to the list.

    *   Supply a Mail::Builder::List object. The list object replaces the
        old one if the list types match

    *   Scalar values will be passed to "Mail::Builder::Address->new". The
        returned object will be added to the object list.

    The Mail::Builder::List package provides some basic methods for
    manipulating the list of recipients. e.g.

     $obj->to->add(EMAIL[,NAME])
     OR
     $obj->to->add(Mail::Builder::Address)

   language
    e-mail text language

   messageid
    Message ID of the e-mail. Read only and available only after the
    "build_message" or "stingify" methods have been called.

   organization
    Accessor for the name of the sender's organisation. This header field is
    not part of the RFC 4021, however supported by many mailer applications.

   priority
    Priority accessor. Accepts values from 1 to 5. The default priority is
    3.

   subject
    e-mail subject accessor. Must be specified.

   htmltext
    HTML mail body accessor.

   mailer
    Mailer name.

   plaintext
    Plaintext mail body accessor. This text will be autogenerated from
    htmltext if not provided by the user or the "autotext" option is turned
    off. Simple formating (e.g. <strong>, <em>) will be converted to pseudo
    formating.

    If you want to disable the autogeneration of plaintext parts set the
    autotext accessor to a false value. However be aware that most spam
    enginges mark e-mail messages without an plaintext part as spam.

    The following html tags will be transformed to simple markup:

    *   I, EM

        Italic text will be surrounded by underscores. (_italic text_)

    *   H1, H2, H3, ...

        Two equal signs are prepended to headlines (== Headline)

    *   STRONG, B

        Bold text will be marked by stars (*bold text*)

    *   HR

        A horizontal rule is replaced with 60 dashes.

    *   BR

        Single linebreak

    *   P, DIV

        Two linebreaks

    *   IMG

        Prints the alt text of the image if any.

    *   A

        Prints the link url surrounded by brackets ([http://myurl.com text])

    *   UL, OL

        All list items will be indented with a tab and prefixed with a start
        (*) or an index number.

    *   TABLE, TR, TD, TH

        Tables are converted into text using Text::Table.

   attachment
     $obj->attachment(Mail::Builder::List)
     OR
     $obj->attachment(Mail::Builder::Attachment)
     OR
     $obj->attachment(PATH[,NAME,MIME])

    This accessor always returns a Mail::Builder::List object. If you supply
    a Mail::Builder::List the list will be replaced.

    If you pass a Mail::Builder::Attachment object or a scalar path (with an
    optional name an mime type) the current list will be reset and the new
    attachment will be added.

    The Mail::Builder::List package provides some basic methods for
    manipulating the list of attachments.

    If you want to append an additional attachment to the list use

     $obj->attachment->add(PATH[,NAME,MIME])
     OR
     $obj->attachment->add(Mail::Builder::Attachment)

   image
     $obj->image(Mail::Builder::List)
     OR
     $obj->image(Mail::Builder::Image)
     OR
     $obj->image(PATH[,ID])

    This accessor always returns a Mail::Builder::List object. If you supply
    a Mail::Builder::List the list will be replaced.

    If you pass a Mail::Builder::Image object or a scalar path (with an
    optional id) the current list will be reset and the new image will be
    added.

    The Mail::Builder::List package provides some basic methods for
    manipulating the list of inline images.

    If you want to append an additional attachment to the list use

     $obj->image->add(PATH[,ID])
     OR
     $obj->image->add(Mail::Builder::Image)

    You can embed the image into the html mail body code by referencing the
    ID. If you don't provide an ID the lowercase filename without the file
    extension will be used as the ID.

     <img src="cid:logo"/>

    Only jpg, gif and png images may be added as inline images.

EXAMPLE
    If you want to send multiple e-mail messages from one Mail::Builder
    object (e.g. a solicited mailing to multiple recipients) you have to pay
    special attention, or else you might end up with mixed contents and
    growing recipients lists.

     # Example for a mass mailing
     foreach my $recipient (@recipients) {
         $mb->to->reset; # Remove all recipients
         $mb->to->add($recipient); # Add current recipient
         
     # Alternatively you could use $mb->to($recipient); which has the
         # same effect as the two previous commands. Same applies to 'cc' and 'bcc'
         
     $mb->plaintext(undef);
         # Reset plaintext, otherwise it will not be autogenerated from htmltext
         # after the first run
         
     $mb->htmltext(qq[<h1>Hello $recipient!</h1> Text, yadda yadda! ]);
         
     my $mail = $mb->stringify();
         
     # Send $mail ... 
     }

IMPORTANT CHANGES
    From 1.10 on Mail::Builder only supports utf-8 charsets for mails.
    Supporting multiple encodings turned out to be error prone and not
    necessary since all modern mail clients support utf-8.

CAVEATS
    Watch out when sending Mail::Builder generated mails with
    Email::Send::SMTP: The 'Return-Path' headers are ignored by the MTA
    since Email::Send::SMTP uses the 'From' header for SMTP handshake.
    Postfix (any maybe some other MTAs) overwrites the 'Return-Path' field
    in the data with the e-mail used in the handshake ('From'). The
    behaviour of Email::Send::SMTP may however be modified by replacing the
    "get_env_sender" and "get_env_recipients" methods. See Email::Send::SMTP
    for more details.
